# nsxiv-rifle

This is a modified version of the [sxiv-rifle][] script.
This script opens an image as well as all the other images in that directory.

One thing to note here is that `-maxdepth` is not POSIX, so it may not be
available on your version of `find` if you're on a non-GNU system.
Please make the following changes if `-maxdepth` is not available for you.
This may cause slight performance decrease.

```diff
-    find -L "$1" -maxdepth 1 -type f -print |
+    find -L "$1" \( ! -path "$1" -prune \) -type f -print |
```

### Sorting

By default, `nsxiv-rifle` will sort the files alphabetically.
Following are a couple more methods of sorting:

* Natural sort (requires GNU sort)

```diff
-        is_img_extension | sort | tee "$tmp"
+        is_img_extension | sort -V | tee "$tmp"
```

* Sort by modification time (requires `stat`)

```diff
-    find -L "$1" -maxdepth 1 -type f -print |
-        is_img_extension | sort | tee "$tmp"
+    find -L "$1" -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec stat -c '%Y %n' {} + |
+        sort -nr | cut -d' ' -f 2- | is_img_extension | tee "$tmp"
```

### URI

`nsxiv-rifle` can also handle `file://` and `trash://` URIs.
`WM_CLASS` will be be set to `nsxiv_trash` when opening trash URI.
You may wish to change your `key-handler` bindings [when browsing trash
images][atom] as it can be used for restoring or permanently deleting the images
via using an [xdg compliant tool for trash management][trash].

An in-lined python3 script `uri2path` is used for URI decoding, if you don't
want a python dependency you may use [this][awk] awk script instead.
